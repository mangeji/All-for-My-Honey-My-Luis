        <div id="content-1" class="toggle-content">
            <h2>I love how gentle you are with me.</h2>
            <p>I saw a reel about having a gentle partner who controls his tone because he knows how sensitive his girlfriend is, and I am so grateful to have that kind of partner. I know that sometimes, or maybe most of the time without me realizing it, I can be pretty annoying. I tend to ask tons of questions to reassure myself. I tend to act immaturely to get your attention. I tend to be so moody most of the time, but nevertheless, you never throw mean words towards me. You never once raised your voice when we are together. You never made me feel that I am annoying, in lieu, you chose to be patient. You hold me gently. You caress me softly. You speak to me kindly. You hug me warmly. Everything about you is just so gentle when it comes to me, and I hope that you'd stay that way.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleContent('content-2')">I love how you make effort to comfort me.</button></p>
            <div id="content-2" class="toggle-content">
            <h2>I love how you make effort to comfort me.</h2>
            <p>I often experience episodes. Days that I get too irritable. Moments where I suddenly get depressed and suicidal. Times where I want to isolate myself from everyone. I get too emotional and hard to handle, yet you make efforts to understand me and make me calm. You may not be great with words; you might not know how to handle my sudden mood swings most of the time, but you still make sure I know that you're always there. You make sure I know that I have someone to lean on. You make sure I am heard. You makes sure I am seen, and I love you for that.</p>

        <p><button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleContent('content-3')">I love your voice.</button></p>

            <h2>I love your voice.</h2>
            <p>Whenever I hear your voice, something in me would suddenly calm down. I like hearing you talk. I love listening to your voice. It's calming — it's comforting. It's so gentle that I can mistaken it as a lullaby. I wanna fall asleep listening to it. It's as if a switch in my mind instantly turns off all my anxieties and negative thoughts whenever I hear you. Oh, how I love to keep a recording of your voice as a keepsake and I'll play it over and over -- never getting tired of it.</p>

            <h2>I love your act of service.</h2>
            <p>As someone who grew up in a household where I got used to doing everything on my own — for someone who is seen as independent, I love how you give me the act of service.  Whenever I need help, you always offer your hand and even if I don't ask you, you still do things for me, and that makes me love you even more. There was a moment when you helped me with my shoes. You helped me wear my socks and shoes. Though it was a circumstance that we need to hurry, still that little action made my heart so happy. You never fail to show that now I got someone to ask when I feel like I can't do it on my own. You made me feel that you are there to do things for me that no one once did. I have someone now who always gets my back on another level of intimacy. I don't have to look back anymore, scared that someone might not catch me when I become risky and fall, because I know you'll be there for me.</p>

            <h2>I love when you make time for me.</h2>
            <p>Even when you're doing something, you still spares me your time and talk to me. I love it when we have some quality time. It makes me feel like I am one of your priorities. Even a small talk can make me smile because I know that despite busy sometimes, you still think of me.</p>

            <h2>I love when you talk about your day.</h2>
            <p>Whenever you share what happened to your day, it also makes me feel the emotion you felt. If you get frustrated with someone, I'll also start beefing with someone I don't even know; And if your happy about something, it also makes me smile. Hearing your share your stories makes me feel that I've really become part of your life. It makes me feel involved. I have never once regretted the day that I met you and that will stay the same until the end. I want to continue hearing stories from you no matter how nonsesical you think it may be. I will be all ears no matter what's it about.</p>

        <div id="content-7" class="toggle-content">
            <h2>I love when you own your mistake.</h2>
            <p>I was sad about something when I wrote this. Though for some it might only be a small matter, but for me, the small things are what matters the most. I can't always open up to you and tell you all that things that made me sad because I know you're already trying and I don't want to give you more pressure, that's why I've always preferred to put it in my private account on Twitter. Whenever you tell me that you saw my tweets, I kinda feel guilty that I can't tell my problems to you directly. It makes me sad and happy at the same time when you own up to your mistakes. I feel happy because you don't just say sorry without knowing what your sorry for, and yet, at the same time I also feel sad because, I feel like if I tell you about stuff that bothers me, I am invalidating your effort. You do your best to not invalidate my feelings even on a tiniest bit of problem I open up and I'm so thankful you are boyfriend. I love you so much, my sweet boy.</p>

            <h2>I love your smile.</h2>
            <p>You may be insecure about you smile, but I want you to know it's one of the things I love about you. When you smile, it also makes me happy. Hearing you laugh is a different kind of medicine. I love seeing you happy. It suits you and I'll do anything to keep that smile. I promised myself to make you the happiest man. I still have a longgg way to go but I'll make sure I'll be able to do that no matter what.</p>

            <p>You are a goal-oriented man. When you decide to do something, you focuses on it until you accomplishes it.  Unlike me, you have self-control.  My baby is a hardworking person and you always do your best on everything — that's something I admire about you.  I will keep supporting you on everything and have your back when you need someone. I'm looking forward to seeing your future because I know it'll be great and you'll succeed.</p>

            <p>My baby is not as showy as I am in our relationship. Despite me having the five love languages and you only got two: physical touch and acts of service, you still makes sure to show me those five in your own way that I can feel it. There are still days when your actions surprises me and make me giddy. It's assuring that despite the social media ruining the standard in a relationship, you never let it bother and change you.</p>

        <h2>For You</h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif; color: gray;">This page contains my love for you. Sometimes, I find it hard to look for words to express my love for you, so instead of just telling you "I love you" everytime, I wrote my feelings down.</p>
        <hr>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleContentWithAlert('content1', 'I love you!')">"How did you know you love him?" they asked.</button>
        <div id="content1" class="hidden-content">
            <p style="color: rgb(9, 105, 9)"><i>I’m pretty sure it wasn’t when I told him “I love you.”</i></p>
            <p>It wasn’t when he became my partner nor when I started being shy around him. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">It was when he became my life.</span> Not because I can’t leave without him nor because he’s my life support, but rather, when he became a reason to live. <i>I knew I loved him the moment he made the thought of living better than death.</i> He was like a lantern who found me lost on my path and lit my way back home.</p>
            <p>I knew I loved him when I didn’t have to catch up with his humor so I can laugh at his jokes. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">I didn’t have to pretend. I didn’t have to hide my colors.</span> Laughing with him came naturally and I then realized sooner that even his corniest punchline can make me giggle.</p>
            <p>I knew I loved him when he hugged my shadow and caressed it gently instead of running away. He never made me feel I was unworthy of love. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">He patiently waited on my front door till I was ready to open it — and when I did, he waited once again until I was willing to welcome him in my arms.</span></p>
            <p>I knew I loved him when I woke up in his arms. Instead of being worried if he finds me too clingy as I lay on his chest, I found peace in him. The once chaotic mind I have suddenly went silent as I slowly drifted into sleep. <i>His heartbeat became a lullaby</i> and <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">I never thought he would be the most comfortable pillow I can have.</span></p>
            <p>I knew I loved him when <i>I saw him look at me with stars in his eyes.</i> They were shining brightly staring at me like I was the only one that matters at that moment. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">He told me I was pretty. He told me I was beautiful…</span> and every time he said those words, <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">I felt like a baby who heard it the first time.</span></p>
            <p>I knew I loved him when I suddenly grabbed my pen and started writing prose for him. It has already been so long since I stopped writing, yet as I think of him, the words just kept flowing through my mind like a river — never ending like an ocean. I never realized I was <i>that</i> romantic until I read what I wrote. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">I saw half of my heart in it and I saw how happy I am because of him.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">I knew I loved him even before he said he loves me.</span> It wasn’t an abrupt realization. I didn’t suddenly wake up realizing it. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">It was gradual and it kept growing.</span> <i>I didn’t fall for him. It never felt like that. Loving him is like bathing under the rain.</i> <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">I just knew I’d love it. I knew it would be worth it.</span> <i>I knew I’d be happy accepting him in my life with arms wide open.</i></p>
        </div>

        <button class="button" onclick="toggleContentWithAlert('content2', 'I love you!')">He never makes me cry.</button>
        <div id="content2" class="hidden-content">
            <p style="color: rgb(9, 105, 9)"><i>Or maybe he does.</i></p>
            <p><span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">I sometimes find myself thinking how lucky I got to have him in my life.</span> When was the last time I felt so safe? When was the last time I felt this confident? When was the last time I was this happy? <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">All those buried feelings were brought back when he broke down my walls and showed me his soul.</span></p>
            <p>With him, I found comfort even in silence. I can be dumb without judgement. With him, I feel loved. He makes me laugh. He makes me smile. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">He makes me happy…</span></p>
            <p><i>Yet, sometimes he makes me cry in the middle of the night.</i></p>
            <p>He treats me so well. He showed me love that I never knew I deserved to receive. <i><b>He makes my heart squeal in joy and the next thing I know, I am already crying.</b></i> Crying my eyes out because I can’t contain how much I love him, how much I appreciate him, and how happy I am with him.</p>
            <p><span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">He never made me cry in pain, however, he does make me cry out of happiness.</span> I am such a crybaby for my man that I cry when I remember how soft and gentle he is with me. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">He takes care of me so well. He does things for me without being told.</span> I cry when I remember how understanding and patient he is. Even on days I chose to isolate myself, he’s always there waiting and understanding every reason I have. He may not be the best at comforting, but he is a great listener.</p>
            <p><i>He is the best boyfriend.</i> My lover who always does his best for me. The man who spends his last money to spend time with me. <i>My darling who told me he’ll fight for me and stay even if the only thing that is clinging to me is his last strand of hair.</i> <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">My baby, my love, mi cariño.</span></p>
        </div>

        <button class="button" onclick="toggleContentWithAlert('content3', 'I love you!')">He changed me...</button>
        <div id="content3" class="hidden-content">
            <p style="color: rgb(9, 105, 9)"><i>But at what cost?</i></p>
            <p>No one can love an angry complicated woman.</p>
            <p><i>But he did.</i></p>
            <p>No man likes a hyper independent woman.</p>
            <p><i>But he did.</i></p>
            <p>No one can be patient enough to stay with a woman who has an unhealed heart.</p>
            <p><i>But he did.</i></p>
            <p>The things I never once thought I’m deserving of, he proved me wrong. He changed my perception. <i>He gave me a new scenery of love to look over.</i> He gave me a reason to give love another chance. <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">He changed me.</span></p>
            <p>He understood that I was used to doing things alone and yet offered me his hand. He understood that I value my alone time and yet he offered me his presence. He knew that behind all this facade of independency is just <i>a girl who wants to be held;</i> <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">A girl who wants to be told that she did a great job on holding on during tough times. A girl who’s been through a lot. A girl whose anger is a symbol of loneliness.</span> He knew that it would be a complicated maze. He knew that risking might even hurt him but even so, he chose to hug the thorns. <i><b>He changed me at the cost of being better.</b></i></p>
            <p>I never knew I needed someone to open the door for me until he did. I never knew my thoughts matter until he validated my every emotion. I never knew that my anger could turn into a sweet ray of sunlight. I never knew that love could feel so magical. Day by day, I find myself <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">loving him more than I did yesterday.</span> Day by day, I find myself thinking of <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">how much more can I love this man for the next days.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">He made me want to change myself.</span> The self-sabotages and negative talks of <i>“he doesn’t deserve me”</i> turned into <i>“I want to keep his smile.”</i> I knew I wasn’t worthy of his love and so, I decided to be worthy of it because I know <i><b>no one can love me more than he did.</b></i> No one can embrace me in a hug warmer than his. No one can go through such lengths for me unless him, and <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">no one can be my darling if it’s not him.</span></p>
        </div>

        <button class="button" onclick="toggleContentWithAlert('content4', 'I love you!')">Why him?</button>
        <div id="content4" class="hidden-content">
            <p style="color: rgb(9, 105, 9)"><i>Why not?</i></p>
            <p>if only they know how you understand me inspite of being confusing</p>
            <p>if only they know much you worry about me</p>
            <p>if only they know how you still give me time even with your packed schedule</p>
            <p>if only they know <span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">how much you love me</span></p>
            <p>if only they know how soundly i sleep at night feeling assured</p>
            <p>if only they know how safe i feel around you and how your touches lulls me to sleep</p>
            <p><i>They'll understand why I love you.</i> They'll understand why I choose you.<span style="background-color: rgb(142, 199, 155);">They'll understand why you.</span></p>
            <p>It's not a <i>"how can I love someone like you?",</i> but rather a <i>"how can I not love someone like you?"</i> question.</p>
            <p>How can I not choose a gentle and caring man like you? How can I not look at you when you're everthing I have prayed and asked God for? How can I not fall for you when you make me this happy? Living is merely something I see humans' naturally do until I met you. You made life worth living. You showed me a different world; with you everything just feels better. I will always be proud of having you as my man. There are a lot of things that I admire about you and I hope someday I can tell them all to you because for now, I can't seem to find the right words to tell why I love you. There are a lot of reasons and I am sure that there will be more in the future.</p>
